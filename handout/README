For Lab 2 you will continue to use source codes of your Lab1. 

You will need to change the Makefile under `handout/test` given
to you for Lab 1, to set the variable `lab2` from false to true
(at line 8).

`cgen_case.cc` contains the code to generating the COOL case 
struct, which you can copy to the right place in your cgen.cc
function. 

The `src_gc/` directory contains the files you need for the
extra credit part of Lab 2. The `src_gc/gc.cc` is the source
code for the modified libc memory allocation functions. 
`src_gc/gc.so` is a prebuilt shared lib from `gc.cc`, you 
can either use it or build your own from `src_gc/gc.cc`. 
`src_gc/Makefile` is meant to replace the Makefile under `handout/test`,
which links the custom libc memory functions of `gc.so`. 
If you choose to do Lab 2 extra credit part, simply copy the
`src_gc/Makefile` and `src_gc/gc.so` to `handout/test` of your 
lab 1 files.
